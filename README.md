# nonlin5

This software was written by Pauli Heikkinen <Pauli.Heikkinen@fmi.fi> and Rigel Kivi <Rigel.Kivi@fmi.fi> to compute coefficients that correct nonlinearity in 125HR spectra. The software is written based on the formulation by Frank Hase <frank.hase@kit.edu>, described in his PhD thesis (https://www.imk-asf.kit.edu/downloads/bod/disshase.pdf) in Chapter 5.
